PRIIPsKIDOtherRisks,"The summary risk indicator is a guide to the level of risk of this product
compared to other products. It shows how likely it is that the product will
lose money because of movements in the markets or because we are not
able to pay you.

We have classified this product as 4 out of 7, which is “a medium” risk
class. This rates the potential losses from future performance at a
medium level, and poor market conditions could impact the ability for
you to receive a positive return on your investment.
Be aware of currency risk. You will receive payments in a different
currency, so the final return you will get depends on the exchange rate
between the two currencies. This risk is not considered in the indicator
shown above. For other risks materially relevant to the product which
are not taken into account in the summary risk indicator, please read the
product’s

This product does not include any protection from future market
performance so you could lose some or all of your investment.

PRIIPsKIDUnableToPayOut,"Tokio Marine Asset Management Co., Ltd. is unable to pay out?
If we are not able to pay you out what we owe you, you are not covered by any national compensation scheme. To protect you, the assets are held
with a separate company, a depositary. Should we default, the depositary would liquidate the investments and distribute the proceeds to the
investors. In the worst case, however, you could lose your entire investment."
