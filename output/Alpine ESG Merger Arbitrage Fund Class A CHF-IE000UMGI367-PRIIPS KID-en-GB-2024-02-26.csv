PRIIPsKIDTerm,"This Fund is an open‐ended UCITS and has an indefinite duration.
The Fund may be terminated at any time in line with the constitutional
documents of the Company. For full investment objectives and policy
details, please refer to the Investment Objectives and Investment Policy
in the Fund’s Supplement to the Prospectus, which are available at
https://sig-global.co.uk/"
PRIIPsKIDObjective,"The investment objective is to seek capital appreciation. The
Fund aims to achieve this by utilizing a merger arbitrage strategy. This
strategy involves investing in a globally diversified portfolio of
companies which are involved in, or which are linked to, mergers and
acquisitions. The Fund shall primarily gain exposure to the global equity
securities of the companies, either directly or indirectly via derivatives.
Also due to the nature of the strategy, and to a limited extent, the Fund
may also receive other instruments including corporate bonds, private
stock, warrants and rights, etc.
The Fund has been classified as promoting environmental, social and
governance characteristics under Article 8 of the Sustainable Finance
Disclosure Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (‘SFDR’). At least eighty percent
(80%) of the Fund’s total investment portfolio (that is, its total long and
short investment positions, except as provided below) will be invested
in accordance with the Investment Manager’s ESG strategy, as further
described in the Supplement.
This threshold applies in respect of the securities to be held directly by
the Fund or via derivatives. Positions in ancillary liquid assets such as
cash and money market instruments (such as treasury bills, commercial
paper and certificates of deposit) held by the Fund will be disregarded
and will not be considered part of the Fund’s investment portfolio for
the purpose of this threshold.
Investments in collective investment schemes (and any indirect
exposure to the underlyings of a collective investment scheme) will also
be disregarded and will not be considered part of the Fund’s investment
portfolio for this purpose. The remaining portion of the Fund’s assets
may be invested in accordance with the Investment Manager’s non‐ESG
strategy, as further described in the Supplement, where the Investment
Manager is of the view that opportunities exist within the financial
markets. Such remaining portion of the Fund’s assets is expected to
consist of assets which are rated below BB by MSCI’s ESG Value
assessment, as further described in the Supplement, or which are not
rated by such assessment. This remaining portion may also include
assets which, at the time of investment, were rated BB or higher as
defined by MSCI’s ESG Value assessment but which may be
subsequently downgraded by MSCI.
The Fund is an actively managed fund which is not managed in
reference to a benchmark. The Fund may invest in emerging markets,
but no more than 20% is expected. The Fund may invest in other funds,
but only up to a limit of 10% of NAV. The Fund will take long and short
exposures which is typical of a merger arbitrage strategy. The Fund's
performance may be strongly influenced by movements in FX rates.
Please refer to the supplement and the prospectus for more
information. Leverage is employed by the Fund, the degree of which is
calculated using the absolute Value at Risk (VaR) methodology. The
Fund may invest in financial derivative instruments (which are contracts
between two or more parties whose price is determined upon the
future performance or outcome of a particular underlying asset or
group of assets). These are used to achieve indirect exposure to a
market, to achieve synthetic shorting, and are also used to manage risk.
These financial derivative instruments may include, but are not limited
to swaps, options, financial futures, warrants, convertible bonds and
forward currency contracts. Please refer to the supplement of the
prospectus for more information."
PRIIPsKIDTargetMarket,"In light of the investment policies of the Fund, an
investment in the Fund is suitable only for those persons and
institutions for whom such investment does not represent a complete
investment program, who understand the degree of risk involved, who
can tolerate a medium to high level of volatility, and who believe that
the investment is suitable based upon their investment objectives and
financial needs. An investment in the Fund should be viewed as
medium to long‐term.
The NAV per share of the Fund will be published daily and made
available on the internet at www.euronext.com and will be updated
following each calculation of NAV."
PRIIPsKIDOtherRisks,"The summary risk indicator is a guide to the level of risk of this product
compared to other products. It shows how likely it is that the product
will lose money because of movements in the markets or because we
are not able to pay you.
We have classified this product as 3 out of 7 which is a ""medium-low""
risk class. This rates the potential losses from future performance at a
medium-low level, and poor market conditions could impact the ability
for you to receive a positive return on your investment.
Be aware of currency risk. You will receive payments in a different
currency, so the final return you will get depends on the exchange rate
between the two currencies.
This risk is not considered in the indicator shown above. For other risks
materially relevant to the product which are not taken into account in
the summary risk indicator, please read the product’s Annual Report or
Prospectus available at https://sig-global.co.uk/. This product does not
include any protection from future market performance so you could
lose some or all of your investment."
PRIIPsKIDUnableToPayOut,"Bridge Fund Management Limited is unable to pay out?
For the protection of investors the fund’s assets are held by an independent depositary State Street Custodial Services (Ireland) Limited, so the
fund's ability to pay out would not be affected by the insolvency of Bridge Fund Management Limited. If the fund is terminated or wound up, the
assets will be liquidated, and you will receive an appropriate share of any proceeds but you may lose part or all of your investment. There is no
compensation scheme protecting you from this scenario."
PRIIPsKIDTakeMoneyOutEarly,"Recommended holding period: 5 to 10 years. The fund has daily liquidity. The recommended holding period of the Fund assumes the Fund being
the sole or majority holding of the investor. The recommended holding period is primarily based on the historic volatility of the underlying
investments and is not directly applicable if used in a portfolio based on the investor’s risk profile. The Fund is not intended for short term
speculation purposes."
